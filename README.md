# Weekenders_APP
This repository includes the technical description from the team Weekenders of the Tech Challenge 2021 posted by  the Technical University of Munich.

## Weekenders App – iOS application for patient food ordering in hospitals
The food ordering process in many hospitals is still manually and takes a lot of time for the staff to complete. Therefore, we want to simplify and digitalize the food order process for Sana Clinics Munich. With the Weekenders App we provide an application for patients, which they can use on their personal mobile phone, to increase patient’s satisfaction and decrease staff’s workload.

### Development standards of this project
**Software:**
AdobeXD: https://www.adobe.com/de/products/xd.html
Optional AdobeXD Mobile App 

**Hardware:**
Optional: iPhone X (the Adobe XD file was optimized for an iPhone X)

### Story
Weekenders App is a software solution, which was developed by students of the Technical University of Munich during the Tech Challenge in the summer semester 2021. Business partner and provider of the challenge was Sana Clinics Munich. As patient food satisfaction is key to the recommendation of the hospital to friends and family Sana Clinics stated the challenge to develop a scalable, cost-efficient and patient centric hospital catering process. 

### What is the Weekenders App?
“99% of all patients cannot evaluate the medical quality of the treatment they receive (aside from pain level). Instead, oftentimes the whole stay is judged based on factors which can be assessed by them – the quality/timely delivery/accuracy of meals” – Sana Clinics
As most of the medical procedures and hospital stays at Sana Clinics are planned and not time critical (e.g., a patient decides to have a replacement knee), Sana Clinics heavily relies on patient recommendations for their hospital. To provide the patients with a pleasant food ordering process, we developed the Weekenders App.
The Weekenders App is planned to be an application for iOS and android mobile end devices. Based on several rounds of interviews our team decided on four key user needs our application should satisfy:

  -	Simplicity: Easy to use for everyone
  -	Integration: Integrable into the current systems
  -	Transparency: More information about the food for the patient
  -	Hybrid: Not fully replacing the human interaction

### How does the Weekenders App work?
The Weekenders app will be implemented in the normal patient journey. When the patient has already scheduled a procedure, he/she will receive a QR code with all patient information together with additional information about the procedure itself. The patient can then sign-in to the Weekenders App before the actual hospital stay, can review all data and correct it if necessary. After checking the information for correctness, the patient will receive a short introduction to the functionalities of the app and how to use and access them. Thereafter, the patient can pre-order food for every day during their hospital stay. It is possible to switch options until the day before the actual food delivery. 
It is important to note that the Weekenders App is an addition to the normal food ordering process, not a replacement. By providing an easy way for the patient to order food, we want to increase transparency for the patient and reduce the time expenditure of hospital staff, so they can focus on their core tasks.

### Advantages of the Weekenders App
*For patients:*
Patients are provided with a simple to use application. The app delivers additional information about each menu, nutrition scores to compare different menus, and automatically excludes all options with ingredients the patient is allergic to. All this information is presented in an intuitive and transparent way. Additionally, the patient has an overview of all the ordered menus, so that incorrect orders can be avoided. 

*For service staff:*
Taking orders from patients is a time consuming and error-prone process. Language barriers and other factors may lead to incorrect orders, which then reflect negatively on the service staff. By reducing the number of patients who need the service staff to order their food, the service staff has more time to take orders from the remaining patients and thus minimize the frequency of errors. Moreover, the service staff has more time on their hand for other important tasks.

*For hospitals:*
Hospitals are enabled to decrease the amount of thrown away food, as patients only order menus they intend to eat. Furthermore, an improved food experience will lead to increased patient satisfaction. Hospital staff is relived and it is possible to achieve cost savings by reducing the number of FTEs needed for the food ordering process. 

## Build:
### Preparation:
How to recreate the Weekenders App:
When we started to build our prototype, we kept the end user, i.e. the patient, in the center of the process. Therefore, we highly recommend using an additional hardware device (e.g., an iPhone X) to simulate the patients experience with the Adobe XD prototype while using the application. 
The first step towards our finished prototype were sketches, which helped us define the key features of the application and a rough overview of the patient’s user journey within the app.

To develop a functional prototype from our sketches in a fast and reliant way we used the software Adobe XD. 
In the following a complete overview of the Weekenders App is given. The high number of screens are a result of the attempt to better simulate the normal user flow of a patient to validate the product idea.

Moving forward we are going to give a short description of each screen concept. As mentioned above, we implemented the same screens in different settings, but explaining every single screen will not provide further inside into our prototype. 
It is important to mention that we connected the screens with the prototype function of Adobe XD. This allows us to simulate a normal app flow for our testers. We will not mention every single connection between screens, but will provide a flowchart and the link to the Adobe XD file of our prototype to help understand the connections between all the options our application provides.

### Welcome and Intro
We first welcome our patient and give a short explanation of the core functionality and features of the application. The patient can click through each screen or skip the intro and directly start with the sign-in and registration process.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58587500/125457577-e734c8f1-a42c-46a6-a951-0c02896f3aa5.png)
